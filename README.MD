### What is MGLib? ###

MGLib is a library designed with ease-of-use in mind, and made to assist plugin developers in creating minigame plugins. Generally speaking, almost all minigame plugins have the same basic functionality built into them. However, this basic functionality (e.g. round management) takes a lot of time to create. If all the core code is effectively the same, why not just use the same exact code instead of rewriting it every time? This is where MGLib comes into play. MGLib provides an API for minigame plugins to use, so that they don't need to write it themselves. This can drastically reduce the size and time investment of individual plugins. MGLib boasts an easy-to-use and understand API, paired with a large featureset, with more functionality being planned and implemented every day.

### How to use MGLib ###

I've written up [a tutorial on BukkitDev](http://dev.bukkit.org/bukkit-plugins/mglib/pages/tutorial/) detailing exactly how to build your own plugin using the library. I don't want to convert it to Markdown or maintain two copies, so for now I must ask you to use that tutorial for reference.

Additionally, the library has [official documentation](http://ci.amigocraft.net/job/MGLib/37/javadoc/) compiled automatically by [my build server](http://ci.amigocraft.net/job/MGLib) for each commit. Feel free to reference that or the documentation for any other build while using MGLib.

### Contribution guidelines ###

Have an idea for MGLib? Know how to Java? Awesome! Just fork the repo and go to town implementing it! I only ask that you verify that your code works before actually submitting your pull request. If I like what you've done, I'll merge it with the master branch, and it'll show up in the next version of the library!

Don't know how to Java? You can still contribute by [submitting a ticket on BukkitDev](http://dev.bukkit.org/bukkit-plugins/mglib/create-ticket/)! Just describe what you want added in detail, and I'll get to work implementing it!
